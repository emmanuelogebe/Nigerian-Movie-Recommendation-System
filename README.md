# Nigerian-Movie-Recommendation-System
A Movie Recommendation System of Nigerian Movies

I have always enjoyed Nigerian movies and series. Recently, I thought about how I could help myself and others interested in Nigerian movies to get recommendations on movies to watch based on a movie they liked and had previously watched.

Of course, the way to do this would be to create accounts on the numerous movie streaming sites that post Nigerian content, indigenous [Iroko TV](https://irokotv.com/), Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc, and search there, but they can only recommend movies within their catalogue. Another way would be to make Google searches. While Google searches are extremely efficient, they might not immediately yield desired results due to the [indexing and ranking criteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eKVizvYSUQ).

I decided to build a Nigerian movie recommendation system, getting data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the largest online database of movie-related information.

This recommendation system is content-based: utilising attributes like the cast, director, synopsis, genre, movie title, etc. It works with the assumption that if a user likes a particular movie, then similar movies would also be of interest.
